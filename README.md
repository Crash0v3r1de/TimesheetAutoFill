# TimesheetAutoFill
I got tired of manually clicking and typing my timesheets so i just created a PDF manipulation program in c# to automate everything for me. Default's to 8 hours per day and you can select the ending day of the week for Friday to auto populate the dates. Also the day you signed it(auto populates).



### This uses the iTextSharp library for PDF manipulation

I'm not the greatest at git repo readme's by the way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
